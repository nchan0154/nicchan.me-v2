She consistently brings eagerness, patience, humility, and emotional intelligence to our mentoring sessions, and she never fails to go above and beyond by finding additional resources that are relevant to my questions and interests. More importantly, Nic is the rare kind of thinker who not only addresses the question at hand, but thinks deeply and holistically enough to figure out why I had the question in the first place.</p><p>As a bootcamp grad, I've worked with quite a few instructors and seasoned developers. None of them can hold a candle to the kind of all-star powerhouse that Nic is, whether it comes to design, development, or giving guidance to junior developers. If you ever have an opportunity to work with Nic, take it. It'll be the best decision you've made in a long time.</p>"

Her knowledge and curiosity go far beyond development: Nic looks at situations from many different angles and works collaboratively with cross-disciplinary teams to deliver meaningful solutions. Simply put, she never loses sight of the bigger picture, even when working on the smallest of details.</p><p>I've been incredibly fortunate to have been mentored by Nic and I very much hope we'll have the opportunity to work together again in the future. Any organisation would be very lucky to work with her!</p>"
