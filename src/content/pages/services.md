I build fast, functional and beautiful websites and applications. I care deeply for the end-user experience and strive for my sites to be inclusive and useable by everyone, regardless of ability.

## The work I do

### Websites / Web Application front-ends

I'm a web generalist, which means that I've worked with a wide variety of technologies, including most major frameworks such as React, Vue, Svelte, etc. Many of my clients don't know what the exact details of the final product will be, and rely on me to be able to architect everything related to the front-end of the site or application.

### Accessibility

I'm a web accessibility specialist and have completed dozens of development projects that require third-party WCAG 2.1 evaluations. As a accessibility-focused developer, I am best for finding major accessibility blockers in your design or codebase and either fixing them directly or educating your team on how to fix them rather than comprehensive auditing services.

### Design Systems

I would love to help you translate your designs into a scalable system that your organization can continue to use for years and years to come. I believe in leveraging web standards and progressive enhancement in order to use less code to do more.

### E-commerce (Shopify)

I've spent many years working on the Shopify platform, and have done everything from storefront full builds to custom plugins. I've worked with <a href="https://switchthemes.co/">Switch Themes</a> to rebuild three of their themes, which boast some of the best customization options in the whole theme store and power tens of thousands of Shopify stores.

### Maps

Many of my recent projects have been focused on interactive web maps. I've also spoken on [accessibility in web maps](/blog/talk-ui-patterns-in-existing-web-map-widgets/) at a W3C Workshop. Most recently, I've been working on [Audiom](https://www.audiom.net/), the world's most accessible map viewer for blind users.

### Speaking & Education

Lately, I've been lucky enough to published a few articles on other platforms and have given talks and workshops to positive reception. Both of these are activities I'd love to do more of in the future, so reach out if this interests you!

## Reasons to hire me

- In my 8+ years of providing web development services, I've successfully completed projects for **clients of all sizes**, ranging from one-person businesses to multinational corporations. I've worked with people of various levels of technical knowledge, ranging from agencies to in-house tech/marketing teams to new founders.

- **I don't need fully completed designs to work.** I'm happy to extend a design system or translate a single desktop design to any other screen size.

- The nature of my work means that I get to use a **wide variety of technologies** and can help you choose the best solution for you. No ginormous Wordpress install with 50 plugins (unless that is exactly what you need!)

- I pride myself on delivering **solutions your team is happy to maintain**. Nothing gives me greater joy than handing over a codebase that feels like a joy to maintain, not a burden.

- In my seven years of freelancing, I've **never missed a development deadline** and it's a streak that I fully intend to keep!

- If you need more than just development, I bring **excellent collaborators** to the table.

## I'm probably not the best fit if...

- **Your project involves a lot of back and forth communication and meetings.** My timezone is GMT +8, and while I'm happy to meet you once a week during your regular working hours even if it is outside of mine, I would like to keep some semblance of work-life balance. I've been working remotely for 8+ years and am well-versed in asynchronous workflows. I have worked successfully with teams on the opposite side of the world for years at a time.

- **You need someone to work on something full-time**. I like to devote part of my working time to researching, writing and speaking and think I am a better developer because of it.

- **You need comprehensive accessibility auditing services, VPATs or other legal documents**. I'm primarily an accessibility-focused developer, not a tester, and I don't have every popular screen-reader/device combination available to me. I recommend my associates [Converge Accessibility](https://convergeaccessibility.com/) if you would like more comprehensive services.

## Core Values

- Our working relationship should be one of **trust**. You've (hopefully!) entrusted me to help you make key decisions, and I will honor that trust by ensuring that we are on the same page regarding scope and pricing. I will let you know if I'm not the right fit your project, and can refer you to my extensive network of freelance contacts.

- I love working with mission-driven organizations and offer special rates for organizations with a commitment to social justice.
