Ive just passed the 10 year mark of my career in web development! A lot of things have happened in that time, so I thought I would celebrate this milestone with this list, which is mostly comprised of little anecdotes/observations that I put on various social media platforms over the years. I've checked off most of these myself, but some of them are referencing general trends I noticed other devs do. Please don't take this list too seriously, I'm not trying to revoke anyone's web developer creds, this is all tongue-in-cheek!

<div class="rss-only">
	<p>
		Updated on June 11 to add an RSS version of the list just in case your feed
		strips out web components.
	</p>
	<p>
		RSS feed readers may wish to click through to the source for maximum
		enjoyment. The website version of this post has a little score tracker that
		will display a message based on your score, but hey, I'm not your boss!

		<li>Been asked to move something two pixels to the right.</li>
		<li>Had an API for a Meta product just break on you, suddenly.</li>
		<li>Broke the website in production.</li>

		</li>
		<li>
			Tried to explain a coding problem to someone else and solved it

		<li>
			Conducted a search for an issue and the search results contained your own

		<li>
			Built a project that is so niche that it is basically only relevant to

		<li>
			Built a [home-cooked
