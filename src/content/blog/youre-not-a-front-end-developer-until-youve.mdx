Ive just passed the 10 year mark of my career in web development! A lot of things have happened in that time, so I thought I would celebrate this milestone with this list, which is mostly comprised of little anecdotes/observations that I put on various social media platforms over the years. I've checked off most of these myself, but some of them are referencing general trends I noticed other devs do. Please don't take this list too seriously, I'm not trying to revoke anyone's web developer creds, this is all tongue-in-cheek!

## The Quiz

<Quiz thresholds={[
  {
    threshold: 0,
    message: "Do you even <s>lift</s> web develop, bro? You might be a normal person who stumble upon this quiz and clicked around for fun. This makes me think you have the hacker spirit in you ðŸ¤“, have you tried learning to code?"
  },
  {
    threshold: 5,
    message: "You might be early on your web development journey, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed enough so thinking about the web ecosystem for prolonged periods of time doesn't make you despair."
  },
  {
    threshold: 11,
    message: "You probably dabble a bit in web development. You know stuff, you just haven't seen all the horrible things yet the web ecosystem."
  },
  {
    threshold: 16,
    message: "You likely do web development for your day job, but maintain a healthy work-life balance. Honestly, good for you!"
  },
  {
    threshold: 22,
    message: "You are the web developer equivalent of the quiet old man in the bar who lurks in the corner and only interjects when the main character reaches a moment of crisis. You've seen some shit, enough to know when to sit down and shut up."
