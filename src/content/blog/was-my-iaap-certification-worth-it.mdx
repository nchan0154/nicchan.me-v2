A reader of the blog asked me if my International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP) Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS) certification was worth it. A ton of thoughts about this have been circling my head recently for reasons I will get into later, so I thought it was high time that I got around to writing this post. I took the exam way back in November 2020, so my details might be a little fuzzy. I will try my best to recall them as faithfully as I can.

## The exam

I signed up for the November 2020 exam around the time I ended a full-time engagement with a long-term client. Although I tried my best to implement accessibility in the day to day work, I really wanted to be able to do more work that was specifically focused on accessibility, and getting certified felt like the best way to get my foot in the door. Of the available credentials, the IAAP WAS certification seemed like the one that aligned most closely with my goals as a web developer who also does accessibility (as opposed to a designer, UX researcher or tester).

When I signed up for the exam, I was still doing full-time work. I made paper flash cards, as I've always found the physical act of writing to be essential for actually remembering things. I also signed up for the paid course at [Deque University](https://dequeuniversity.com/), which I found to be quite helpful (not sponsored). Once I ended the full-time contract, I had a couple of weeks where I only had part-time work, so I basically studied as much as I could for those two weeks outside of my working hours. I was lucky enough to pass the test on the first try, which was great for me because I don't know if I would have been able to find the time to study on top of a full-time job.

The questions I struggled with the most were questions about keyboard shortcuts for different screen readers, and questions about different laws around the world. This may be a little odd, but when I use the keyboard, I don't consciously think about what keys I'm pressing, I basically remember what finger motion I do to activate the key. I also have a fancy ergonomic keyboard so I remap a bunch of default shortcuts to be more comfortable for me, so remembering combinations that feel arbitrary is genuinely pretty difficult.

I'm more well-versed in the legal aspects now, especially now that I've done more accessibility work, but I do feel that it is slightly western-centric in that I'm sure there are plenty of other accessibility experts who do not live in the regions that the test tends to ask about. Some people have also levied the criticism that such a focus on rote memorization for these kinds of facts is ableist, which I think is important to keep in mind.

## The impact it had on my career

I do think it helped, marginally. In my experience, people in the accessibility field do not find IAAP certifications to be a particularly useful as a benchmark for how 'good' someone is at accessibility. Almost none of the folks I respect the most in the field have a certification. However, it is somewhat of a useful tool for appealing to the 'box-checking' folks who might be in charge of an organization's accessibility processes. I've been on teams where I was the only person with a IAAP certification, and the fact I had one was seen as an asset for those seeking work in government or education, because they could point to my certificate as additional validation.

As a self-taught developer, I've often had bouts of imposter syndrome. It can be difficult to feel secure in your accessibility knowledge when you know that mistakes can contribute to the further oppression of marginalized groups. This is something I genuinely struggle with, even while trying to remind myself that I am still human and that I will mess up sometimes. Having some sort of validation in the form of a very expensive piece of paper did feel like a shield against the insecurities in the early part of my career.

However, despite this, I can't say I've ever gotten any accessibility work by virtue of just being listed on their site. They used to have a public facing page that just listed everyone by name, but now they've switched to a [verification form](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certification-portal/s/certified-professional-directory) type of interface. They've also now listed my country as China which is not particularly useful for me as I do not speak Mandarin well enough to do accessibility work with it and it may deter my actual audience (basically anyone who speaks English) from looking me up.

If I try to think about all the inbound leads I've had related to accessibility, most of them were via word-of-mouth. Of those who didn't reach out as the result of a direct referral, one mentioned a blog post that I wrote, and two have mentioned watching my recorded talks on accessibility. This definitely isn't a statistically significant number of results, but going forward I'm likely to invest more time and effort in those areas instead.

## The CAEC process

We've reached the spicy part of the post! I recently came across [this post by Rian Rietveld.](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7338112202932936705/) For those in the accessibility field, Rian should need no introduction. She is a pillar in the industry and her contributions have made the web a better place. The post is well-worth the read, but to summarize, Rian was frustrated that her paid, public work for various governments and on the Wordpress Accessibility Team did not count for her Continuing Accessibility Education Credit (CAEC) requirements.

What are CAECs? I'm glad you asked! The IAAP certificates are valid for 3 years, and require a certain number of hours of additional engagement in the accessibility field outside of paid work. The exact number of hours varies by certificate, the WAS certificate I took requires 35 CAECs, which is around 12 CAECs a year.

To understand Rian's post, we need to look a bit more at the specific CAEC requirements. I've rounded them up into the summary below:

1. Professional Development CAECs are counted in 15-minute increments rounded up to the nearest number. Accepted formats:
   - Attending live/archived webinars or workshops
   - Attending and completing online course(s)
   - Attending accessibility presentations at industry conference(s)/summit(s)
   - Attending course(s) from educational institutions- Note capped at 15 CAECs per course per year.
2. Sharing Your Accessibility Knowledge CAECs breakdown
   1. One hour of structured teaching content delivery = 3 CAECs (two hours to prepare for one hour of structured delivery)
   2. Featured speaker or speaking engagement = 2 CAECs per hour of speaking
   3. One Year’s Active Volunteer Committee Work within the Accessibility Profession= 5 CAECs per committee
   4. Publication of blog series (more than five) regarding accessibility = 5 CAECs per year
   5. Publication of professional or scholarly article = 5 CAECs per article
   6. Publication of a book regarding accessibility = 6 CAECs
   7. Organizing accessibility Meetups = 1 CAEC per event as the organizer
   8. Organizing local accessibility conferences = 5 CAECs per event. Must be listed as a lead position on the conference organizing committee.
3. IAAP Volunteering CAEC breakdown
   1. One Year’s Active IAAP or G3ict Committee Work = 5 CAECs per committee
   2. One hour of IAAP volunteer service (outside of committee work) = 1 CAEC
   3. Please note: Volunteer engagement is capped at 15 CAECs per year.

To sum it up, the IAAP's wants you to earn your CAECs through the Professional Development category. This is the only category where each hour of your time is granted one whole CAEC, except for the option where you can sign up to volunteer for the IAAP itself, which also grants you one CAEC per hour you spend.

Rian's feedback, that her paid work for open standards and public distribution should count for CAECs, and I fully agree. She met with an IAAP representative and it seems they will make steps forward in this regard. It's much needed, and I really hope they listen to her feedback.

Besides this, I still have a few other complaints.

For the Professional Development category, basically the only realistic category in which people can rack up points, has a heavy location bias. When I was doing research for this post, I found one of the IAAP folks saying that they managed to achieve their year's credits by attending one lunchtime webinar a month, implying that it was that easy. Do you know what time that lunchtime webinar is at for me? It's 1am! I am barely holding back my rage here.

I live in a place where there aren't really any local or far-but-timezone-appropriate events I can attend during normal working hours. I'm mostly limited to online, live-streamed events that I can watch later. And I'm so grateful that there are at least a few free options to choose from. If [Inclusive Design 24](https://inclusivedesign24.org/2025/) and [axecon](https://www.deque.com/axe-con/) didn't exist, I probably wouldn't have a way to get enough CAECs without shelling out for IAAP's own paid webinar series.

As grateful as I am that free resources exist, I can't count the number of times I've sat through a thinly-veiled product advertisement or an Accessibility 101 talk for a CAEC. I can't help but wonder if there are better uses of my time. To put it frankly, I don't really know how much time I have left on this earth, but I do know that I want to spend as little of it as possible in yet another webinar that I don't care about.

Which brings us to our second point, the Sharing Your Knowledge CAEC requirements are so strict that they are functionally useless. I’ve never written a book, but I’m sure it takes more than 5 hours. If you’ve organized an accessibility conference but aren’t the number one lead organizer, you’re out of luck.

If you are paid for any of this work, this means it is invalid for CAECs. As a freelancer, I have no company behind me that will sponsor my presence at any events. If I choose to speak at an event, I may receive a stipend that would cover 1/10th of the hourly rate I would charge if I were doing development work, and somehow, this invalidates the CAEC.  I get it, people who are sponsored by their organizations shouldn't get a free pass at a certificate renewal, but this seems like an unnecessarily strict boundary, as Rian pointed out.

Additionally, the other work that is deemed appropriate for the CAEC is just... completely out of touch with what web accessibility experts do. Forgive me for tooting my horn for a tiny bit, but I have:

- Written blog posts that are referenced by multiple governments around the world
- Written a posts for publications that reached hundreds of thousands of page views, for which I received a nominal stipend equivalent to one or two hours of my normal rate
- Conducted free (publicly documented) accessibility testing for a variety of products and organizations, leading to more accessible products used by millions
- Contributed to the A11y Project, including a substantial rewrite adding dark mode to the site

Honestly, this pales in comparison to the amount of work other folks I know do. I'm only really a 'few times a year' blogger at best, many folks I know publish on a regular schedule. Not one of these accomplishments would count for a single CAEC. The requirement that blog posts be in a series of five is honestly baffling to me. I honestly believe that some of the most important pieces of accessibility writing ever are in the form of single blog posts. There are many, many blogs by accessibility experts who I consider required reading for entering the field, and none of this would count for any 'Sharing your knowledge' CAECs! I can't even tell you the last time I read an academic accessibility paper as part of my day-to-day work, but I read accessibility blog posts every single day.

The failure to include open-source work also feels like a glaring omission. The WAS certification is described as a certification in technical digital proficiency, it's just weird to me that doing the very same work for free is somehow not included. There are some people I know who refuse to get the certification because it would take away time from their ability to do work with actual impact, and I respect the hell out of that position.

My conclusion about all of this is that the IAAP does a very good job of promoting accessibility as a money-making business, but not as a field. Why else would you even consider any form of co-operation with [overlay companies](https://karlgroves.com/why-is-iaap-giving-special-treatment-to-overlays/)? The Professional Development CAECs are all in easily monetizeable forms, and lead to partnerships with those offering academic courses or paid conferences, even if they don't relate to how most of us actually stay on top of the field.

## Adventures on the IAAP site

The final thing that inspired me to write this post is the absolutely horrible time I had trying to submit my CAECs. I'm not exactly sure when, but at some point, the IAAP moved over to a new portal system to submit the credits.

Upon navigating to the portal, I was greeted with this login form.

You might think those grey boxes represent inputs, right? Ignoring the fact they use the problematic 'placeholder text as label' technique, there is already a Non Text Contrast violation in the fact that the input border or background color don't contrast enough against the page background.

	width="765"
	height="128"

The reality is actually much worse! This white rectangle isn't an input, the actual
input area is a tiny rectangle within the boundaries of the white box, featuring
a focus outline that does not meet contrast requirements! People I know who wouldn't
dare call themselves accessibility experts out of respect for the field wouldn't
even make this mistake!

Once you're in, the process to submit the CAECs is such poor UX that I may have burst a blood vessel while trying to fill the form in. There is a rich text field to list out what activities you participated in. Since some activities are officially preapproved for CAECs, if it were me I would have made some kind of user interface where you could select a provider, then check off a list of checkboxes instead of having to type it up and calculate the total number of hours yourself. It would probably speed up the process on the validation end too. But this next step is the part that really got to me.

The previous page informs you that there will be a place to upload the associated files to prove you've participated in whatever activities. Why they aren't on the same page, I'm unsure. When landing on the next page, this is what I see (I've blanked out some information here.)

	alt="The IAAP certification portal.

"Aha, the Files button, that must be it!" I thought. But upon clicking it, I realized my mistake, this was actually not the button that allows you to upload files, which is in a section much farther down the fold. This is in fact, a link, and upon clicking the entirety of your forms progress is lost, an experience so frustrating that it caused me to write this 2500 word blog post on a Friday night.

I genuinely don't like to nitpick people unnecessarily, I think it can hurt well-intentioned folks trying to learn. But if you are judging us on our accessibility, I do believe that gives us the right to judge you back. I find it a bit embarrassing that the organization that certifies accessibility experts has such obvious accessibility errors that can be detected with even a superficial glance.

The accessibility field already struggles with the 'divide' between experts and disabled people. With a test that has an ableist focus on rote memorization, a re-certification process that adds additional burden onto a group that may already struggle with having enough spoons to do unpaid work, and an inaccessible website, it sometimes feels like the IAAP just widens the gap between practitioners and the disabled people they're meant to serve.

To come back to the original question, I'm still on the fence about renewing my certification. I don't do a bunch of enterprise or government work so it's been less useful than I would have hoped. I would rather work with people who already vaguely know who I am and what I bring to the table, but the fact that I would have to take the exam again to regain the certification is definitely holding me back a bit. There is probably enough relevant, on-demand content that I was going to watch anyway to squeeze out another renewal, but I would never judge an accessibility professional for choosing to forgo the certification.
