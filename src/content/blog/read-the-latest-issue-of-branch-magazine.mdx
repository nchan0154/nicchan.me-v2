I always had a strong interest in environmental and sustainability causes. At age twelve, I made an unusual decision for a child of that age and decided to boycott Hong Kong Disneyland. This was disappointing news to my father, who had worked on the project and understandably wanted to to take his children to Disneyland to show off his hard work. I had boycotted it because the land reclamation efforts for Disneyland had destroyed much of the habitat for Hong Kong's most adorable endangered species, the pink dolphin. Do you know how hard it is for a twelve year old to boycott Disneyland? It's pretty dang hard.

Still, while I **cared**, and have always cared, I was never really able to translate that care for the environment into my professional work. I tried my absolute best to build fast, performant sites that are usable by everyone and while that definitely has some impact on sustainability, I wouldn't say that I focused on it or developed any sort of reputation as a sustainability expert.

Needless to say, I was pretty shocked when Fershad reached out to me to consider applying for the [Grid-aware websites advisory group](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/introducing-our-grid-aware-websites-project/), a group of technical experts to help advise on the development of a toolkit that would allow a website to respond to the 'cleanliness' of a user's energy grid.

As I read through the proposal, key phrases jumped out at me. "Oh, they want to gather folks from open-source CMS sustainability teams, that's definitely not me. Also, they want people who have already worked on public sustainability initiatives, that's not me either." Still, the idea sounded really interesting, and I managed to suppress my imposter syndrome long enough for me to fill out the form and hit apply.

I'm so, so glad I did. Against all odds, I was accepted, and getting to geek out with folks over sustainability and how it relates to the front-end every now and then has definitely been a highlight of a crappy year. There's just something about occasionally being surrounded by people who give an actual shit about the environment; it feels like a much-needed panacea to living in a world where it seems like people are happy to boil an ocean if it saves them time personally.

I know that the work we do here is a small drop in the bucket compared to way AI is rapaciously gobbling up the internet, but it has done wonders for my mental health and my desire to go on and keep fighting, and that feels more important now more than ever.

## The Green Web Foundation rocks

The folks over at the Green Web Foundation are some of the loveliest people I've had the opportunity to meet. Chris Adams is so incredibly articulate that even having my words summarized by him after a group discussion feels like a transformative experience. Hannah Smith has such a joyous presence that even though the meetings usually occur after a long day of work in my timezone, I instantly feel perk up whenever I'm in one. Fershad Irani, AKA Fish, is so cool and smart that you think he would be incredibly unapproachable, but he's actually incredibly friendly and chill. All that's to say, if you ever get the chance to work with or support the Green Web Foundation, don't pass up the opportunity! People working at smaller, mission-driven organizations don't get enough thanks or recognition compared to companies with larger marketing budgets, especially a time when the wider culture is doing its best to trample all over their work. I just wanted to say a big thank you to the Green Web Foundation for all their hard work!s

This leads me to the title of this post, which is to read the latest issue of Branch magazine. This issue is called 'Attunement – Designing in an Era of Constraints', and has a lot of wonderful writing about what folks have been up to in the grid-aware advisory group. As I've mentioned, I've always found it difficult to connect the things I cared about with my work in web development, and if you relate at all to this sentiment, you might find this issue an especially good one to check out.

- [A Digital Almanac: Attuning Our Web Habits to the Natural World](https://branch.climateaction.tech/issues/issue-9/a-digital-almanac-attuning-our-web-habits-to-the-natural-world/) by Lucy Sloss. Quiet and contemplative, this piece contextualizes sustainability within larger trends in technology in a way that makes me feel hopeful.
- [Designing a Grid-Aware Branch](https://branch.climateaction.tech/issues/issue-9/designing-a-grid-aware-branch/) by Hannah Smith, Fershad Irani, and Tom Jarrett. You all know I **love** a good case study. This one is no exception, I especially love all the little details and specifics, there are a tons of valuable practices here that make me reexamine how I build websites.
- [AI, Climate, and the Global Majority: A Just Transition Toward COP30 and the People’s Summit](https://branch.climateaction.tech/issues/issue-9/ai-climate-and-the-global-majority-a-just-transition-towards-cop30-and-the-peoples-summit/) by Lori Regattieri. A thought-provoking look at AI and the energy crisis from the perspective of climate justice and technological sovereignty. If this has to happen, it needs to happen with a consideration for the many folks who would be most affected by climate disaster.
- [Finding Harmony between Business and Sustainability with Grid-Aware Computing](https://branch.climateaction.tech/issues/issue-9/finding-harmony-between-business-and-sustainability-with-grid-aware-computing/) by Michael J. Oghia, James Hobbs (Contributor) and Andy Eva-Dale (Contributor). As an accessibility person, communicating why you should implement something to corporate stakeholders is something I'm simultaneously pretty familiar with and not very good at. Who would have known that 'you should give a shit about other people!' is not a particularly effective argument in the boardroom. I appreciate the deep dive into how to communicate the importance of giving-a-shit into corporate speak.

## Author's note

Hey Nic? You've forgot to explain what the heck a Grid-aware website actually is.

I know, and it's coming! Due to some changes in the availability of the Electricity Maps API, I've had to hit pause on a demo, and I'd really like to have something that people can click around. In the mean time, the aforementioned [Branch Magazine redesign article](branch.climateaction.tech/issues/issue-9/designing-a-grid-aware-branch/) has a really good explainer.
