This is a post in a series about building my new website, check out [the previous post in this series.](/blog/building-my-new-website-part-4/)

## Artwork

I've always been torn about having an artwork section on my site. It's not at all related to what I do professionally, and I always wondered if I would be judged for having a section dedicated to it. At some point, I stumbled Josh Crain, a fellow web developer's website, and I really enjoyed the artwork section. His work is full of light, and I really resonated with his artistic journey. I'm so glad I found his site, because it helped me decide that I didn't particularly care any more if anyone thought negatively about it, and I implemented an artwork section for my site! This isn't a particularly popular page on the site, but those who like it seem to really love it, so I'll chalk this up as a success.

Selecting the pieces was the most difficult part. I knew I wouldn't be able to feature too many works on this page with the layout that I had, so I had to be more choosey than I'd like! In the end, I chose a mix of pieces from the mediums I've been enjoying in the past few years (digital, but only the [HEAVYPAINT](https://www.heavypaint.com/) program) and gouache, with a mix of plein air pieces in there.

Development was straightforward as this was one of the very first sections that I designed when coming up with the site. As soon as I saw my first View Transitions demo, I knew I wanted to utilize it to power this section. When a window in this section is maximized, the window itself is crossfaded and the caption fades in, but a separate view transition on the artwork makes it scale up smoothly. I really can't believe what you can get with CSS (and a sprinkle of JS to manage state and fallbacks!)

## Fonts

It's at this point I start doing some performance testing. One of the key issues was that I had a huge amount of Cumulative Layout Shift as the fonts came in. The font I had chosen, W95FA is pretty narrow compared to other fonts, and I wanted to see if I could minimize the amount of jank as the fonts came in. The layout of my site meant that containers resizing would feel especially choppy. I also knew that I would want to add a toggle between pixel and anti-aliased fonts, as it was a setting I've seen in video games to improve accessiblity for those who struggled with reading pixel fonts. Switching between the two would need to feel pretty seamless, with as little layout shift as I could manage.

At some point, I had stumbled upon the website [Modern Font Stacks](https://modernfontstacks.com/), which provides a list of font fallbacks by style to cover every OS. I really liked the Humanist font stack, but the question remained on how to make sure the transition was seamless. At some point, I discovered this helpful little [Font Fallback tool](https://screenspan.net/fallback), which lets you upload a font and then visually adjust the new `size-adjust`, `ascent-override`, `descent-override` and `line-gap-override` properties with sliders in order to create a seamless fallback. This is an absolutely wonderful tool, my only gripe is that it doesn't have a whole bunch of fallback fonts, so I had to edit the source code so I could make it work with my chosen stack. I think this kind of touch is the kind of thing that adds a lot of polish to a website, but is often overlooked.

## Work

I was really dreading the work section. Because I had places where I was showing desktop screenshots, mobile screenshots, sometimes in comparison with eaachother, I knew I had to come up with layouts that would work for 1-2 images of any aspect ratio and an optional caption, which is a lot more challenging than a design-rookie like me initially thought. I really did not want to be in a position where I would have to write new styles every time I added a case study, so I decided to embrace asymmetry and came up with a limit of three image layouts that I could use as needed.

I also decided to keep the chunky background line I had in the previous version of my site as a design element, with the addition of pixel half tones in order to fit in better with this version. I've always wanted to do fun, CSS Grid overlapping layouts with different textures, but never had the chance to on client work. I try to treat my portfolio like a garden: you don't need permission to grow things in your own garden, so you might as well plant what makes you happy. I'm not entirely sure if this metaphor is appropriate, I've never grown up in a place where I could have a garden and I am well known as a plant-murderer, so take this with a grain of salt.
