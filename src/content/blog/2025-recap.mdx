I've never been one to write these kinds of posts, but I've really enjoyed reading these! Hearing that my buddies had small moments of joy and success makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside, despite the overall mood of 2025.

For me, the overall theme of this year was survival. I knew with several months out of the year gone to theme development, I wasn't going to break my personal record for income, but that's fine by me. I know how badly others in our industry have been affected by the current economic climate, so being able to stay abreast of all my bills is good enough for me. There was a lot of suffering all around, much of it from systems that didn't have to be that way, and that kind of suffering is uniquely painful. I am grateful to be shielded from most of that this year, but it still weighs heavy on my heart.

It's now time for a very abrupt change in tone, so onto the recap!

## Web development

### Shopify Theme

We got the [Shopify theme](/blog/we-launched-our-first-shopify-theme/) out! I won't ramble on about it since I already covered it, but needless to say, it was a tremendous effort. With 2025 behind us, I'm feeling a little mixed about the Shopify ecosystem and the direction the leadership is taking, but I'm tremendously proud of what Marianne and I accomplished.

Finishing the theme and then immediately jumping into client work felt like finishing a marathon and hopping onto a treadmill (who am I kidding, this is a very unqualified use of this metaphor), and in some ways I'm still recovering from that time period. My personal tendency is to overwork myself to the point of exhaustion rather than procrastinate, and that's something I need to actively keep fighting in the future.

### Client work

I got to work with some very fun and cool clients, both old and new. I've always considered myself a developer's developer, in that I like working with teams where they look at the code as part of the end product, not just the website itself. Getting to geek out over the technical details together is something I enjoy, and want to do more of next year! Shoutout to [Set Studio](https://set.studio/), [CloudFour](https://cloudfour.com/), [Tetralogical](https://tetralogical.com/) and Justin Veiga. All of them are amazing, and I'm honored that they placed their trust in me this year.

### Going viral

I went viral a few times this year. I thought the traffic bump from hitting several industry newsletters was already sizeable. Even reaching the fifth page on Hacker News usually results in quite a bump compared to my daily visitors. Reaching the #1 spot on Hacker News had emails coming in at a rate of one per minute, and I got two years worth of page views in a few hours, which left me hyperventilating under my desk.

Overall, this wasn't a bad thing, despite how it felt in the moment. I received many lovely and kind comments/emails (and bug reports!) and they still trickle in till this day.

However, this experience taught me I'm pretty happy with my current audience size as is. I have enough of a readership that there is a non-zero chance that people I respect may have heard of me, but I don't have to deal with any of the consequences of celebrity on a regular basis. In this metric-driven world where everyone is trying to do whatever it takes to make the number go up, I think this was a valuable lesson to learn early. If you're reading this, I'm grateful you are here!

### Grid-aware websites

My time on the [Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/)'s Grid-Aware Websites advisory group came to an end. I really enjoyed getting to [think about sustainability](https://nicchan.me/blog/exploring-grid-aware-websites/) as it relates to our industry. While I still think there's a way to go before grid aware websites are become widely adopted, it was exciting to bring awareness to it and I look forward to learning more from the green tech world.

### Conferences, travel and speaking

I made it to my first industry conference since 2019, the wonderful Smashing Conference in Freiburg! Both the Smashing team and conference attendees were so friendly and interesting, I had so many conversations about people's passions! It's genuinely nice to talk about things other than work sometime. It also was intriguing to me how many folks were working on accessibility — a heartening sign that the European Accessibility Act is having some impact. Coming from a place where most web professionals don't even know what accessibility is, it was very refreshing.

Overall, it was wonderful to see so many friends both old and new, and as a bonus, I got to tack on a few fun days in Paris with Marianne to the start of the trip. I haven't been to Europe since my teenage years, and it took my breath away. Some day I'd love to be back for a painting trip, and to hit up the many highlights I missed! I didn't venture into the Louvre because I knew it would take me at least two days to get to, but the Musée de l'Orangerie was a standout and I can't stop thinking about the experience of seeing Monet's work up close.

I finished off the year by speaking at a few events, something I also haven't done in quite a few years. Thanks to the wonderful team at [ID24](https://inclusivedesign24.org/2025/) (especially Patrick Lauke and Eric Bailey) and to Sia Karamalegos at the [11ty Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/) for making it a smooth process, even though I was stressed out of my mind for two straight months. I always underestimate how long it takes to prepare for speaking events — it takes me like a full week to prepare a talk of any length. I want to clean up the transcripts and some point and post them here, please hold me to it! The response to the talks was overwhelmingly positive, and it made me appreciate the web community more.

### The future?

One of the things I learned about myself this year is that it's important that I enjoy the **process** of doing my job. Like many web folk, I didn't plan to become web developer (I studied art), but I have come to enjoy the process of building a mental model of how things will work, as well as the process of reasoning about problems when they inevitably come up.

I hate what the current AI hype is doing to the world, and even if none of the bad things about it existed, I don't personally enjoy the process of begging and cajoling the computer to spit out something acceptable. It feels much more like gambling than problem solving to my brain. I'm not sure how (or when) exactly the impact of this realization will manifest; I want to continue building for a web I love, but maybe that's a future that's no longer possible. We'll see.

In my case, I don't have any human dependents, debt or extenuating factors that might pressure me into making more financially responsible decisions, and so I'm privileged enough to try to hold out for work that is gratifying in some way. Pleasures of a DINK household, I guess?

## Personal & Creative

### Cats

I adopted a third cat! I picked her up on a complete whim due to her striking resemblance to my previous cat, and I'm happy to say that I don't regret it at all. Miette (named by the folks on Mastodon) is settling in well and has somehow managed to improve the relationship between the resident cats, while discovering new ways to be an adorable menace. I want to produce some silly art to help people differentiate my three (kinda) black cats, stay tuned!

### Touching Grass

Thankfully, I managed to get my health back on track this year. For the past few months, I've been successfully managing my work-related chronic pain condition through regular exercise. Until now, it was something I had to keep under control with a regular combination of physiotherapy, massage and painkillers, so I'm happy to have made progress in this area. Not being in terrible pain is a great motivation to go to the gym, as it turns out.

I also managed to participate in a hike organized by a local farm recently. I love getting to venture out to other parts of Hong Kong that I don't see in my daily life, and I want to overcome my plant-killer tendencies, so I'm thinking about joining the weekly farming cohort next year! If not, I still want to participate in more one-off events. Growing things scratches the same itch in my brain as building things.

### Gaming

I played a lot more video games year, thanks to not struggling as much with the chronic pain thing. Many of these games were co-op games with far away friends — I'm so happy we got to rekindle our friendships with some good ol' fashioned screaming and yelling. My favorite co-op game of the year was V Rising, which feels like a video game **made** for me. I loved the combat, the crafting and getting to design and build a gothic castle. I'm thinking about starting a third run, solo this time, just to enjoy the world and environments a bit more, along with the increased challenge of playing on Brutal mode.

My top solo game of the year was Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I'm a lifelong fan of JRPGs (and also art, duh) so this game also felt uniquely special. JRPG stories often feel quite overplayed and tropey, but this one was really brought to life by stunning motion-capture and voice acting performances. The fantasy environments were creative and beautifully designed in a way that felt really intentional, and the soundtrack is something that I appreciate more and more with every re-listen. This undoubtedly makes my top 10 games of all time list, and I have to actively try to not ramble on about it forever, please, just play it!

Honorable mentions go to Hades II (whose main flaw is coming after Hades I, a **perfect** game), Ember Knights, Necesse, Death's Door and Fantasy Life i, all of which were enjoyable and occupied significant chunks of my time this year.

### Art

Despite the lack of new material on my Instagram, I did draw pretty regularly! I went to life drawing quite a bit, and it turns out that being forced to censor an errant nipple is enough of a blocker to not post the image at all. I didn't paint much, often choosing quicker medium like markers and colored pencils, which made for a fun combination. I'm not too upset at this development, but I do have quite a few images bouncing around in my head that I want to realize in some way or another. I'm struggling a lot more with getting larger creative projects done. At some point in the process, I start to doubt my own ability to realize the vision and so I end up not trying at all. I think that's why I've been gravitating towards art practices like plein-air and life drawing. You show up and try, and that removes the problem of translating the vision you've built up in your head into reality.

One of my few goals for 2025 was to get my work into some kind of art show. That didn't happen this year! My regular life drawing place might have a group exhibition next year, so maybe 2026 is the year?

## Closing thoughts

Wow, that's quite a bit more than I intended to write! 2025 felt like a whirlwind as I was living it, and looking back, that's definitely reflected in the amount of stuff I did. I've never been one for future goal setting (I hate disappointing my future self), but I do think I can scribble down a few brief hopes and dreams for the next year. Hoping for better things feels like a trap at this point,
