It’s 2025 and I’m titling blog posts with song lyrics as if I were thirteen again. I'm not even really a fan of The Killers but it felt like it summed up the last few months for me. I also figured, if it's even half as good for breaking a blogging hiatus as it is for warming up the crowd at karaoke, it was a fitting title as any. Hello readers, it sure has been a while\!

I have committed a huge marketing sin, which is releasing a well-received redesign and then dropping off the face of the earth. I completely failed to take advantage of any of the momentum the increased traffic brought. The truth is, during these past few months I have been working on getting a product out. When confronted with the reality of a complete lack of income for half a year, I can't decide if I either have a personality flaw where it is extremely difficult for me to let go and take a break, or I am operating completely rationally under the rules of capitalism. Either way, the past half a year had many days where I was working seven days a week, and it really took its toll on me.

Now that the product is out the door, I can focus some much-needed attention on other things, including the blog\! I might post more about the project in the future, but we shall see. I have a strong fear of sounding spammy or overly promotional, I feel I owe it to my readers.

Unfortunately, during the past few months, I also managed to lose all of my draft blog posts, so it’s time to start completely fresh. I’ve been tagged by my lovely mutual and wonderful designer [Jan Marten](https://janmaarten.com/) to complete this little post template, and I figured it would be an easy re-entry into blogging. Check out his writing for thoughtful pieces on accessibility and privacy.

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

I’ve been freelancing for almost a decade now, and honestly, publishing a blog was an attempt at marketing. I don’t tend to write content that is particularly ‘clicky’, so I can’t say that I’ve done a very good job at it, but I have made some really wonderful connections through this blog, so I can’t say it’s been a total failure\! I have had just one inbound lead reach out to me and mention the blog, but they’ve been a great partner over the years that shares my values,.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?

I’m a huge fan of having your own personal site\! My website is currently an Astro site, and every post is a .mdx file (as opposed to vanilla Markdown), just because I have an Image component. I’m still feeling like that’s a risky bet, we’ll see what happens by the time the next redesign comes around\! You can read more about the decisions that went into this in [this series on redesigning my website](https://www.nicchan.me/blog/building-my-new-website-part-1/), which I still fully intend to finish, heh.

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

I would not blog if it were on a platform I didn’t control, it’s never really interested me. My desire to not be perceived is only occasionally overpowered by my passion for a topic. \[insert two  wolves inside you meme\]

## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?

I really loved the tool Writerie by [Michael Scharnagl](https://justmarkup.com/)\! Now that it’s gone, I am still looking for the best place to keep all my posts. My main criteria is that it allows me to export to Markdown. I’m open to suggestions, let me know if you really love your blogging flow.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

My interest in blogging is fairly constant, but easily affected by inertia. This is probably slightly toxic behavior, but I usually only manage to get a post out quickly when I’m feeling riled up. Otherwise, I just let it sit for a while until I can give it a re-read with a fresh perspective.

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

If you haven’t noticed, I’m very much a let it cook kind of girlie\! The one thing you can count on is that I will always be late to a trend, so if I blog on a topic, I have to really make sure that something is worth reading, even after a hundred other people have written about it.

People who manage to publish quality posts on a regular schedule amaze me. I think I need to learn to lower the bar a little. Bloggers I regularly enjoy often let a typo or two slip through the cracks, but it’s not something that affects my perception of them. It’s probably worth letting some imperfection come through if I can publish more regularly than twice a year.

## What are you generally interested in writing about?

Not to sound like a rebel, but the things you won’t find on corporate blogs. This isn’t to disparage those who publish posts on more popular subjects, it’s just that for me personally, I only really have the impulse to write when I feel that there is something missing from the discourse about a topic and I feel like I can bring my own unique spin to it. Since I’m pretty slow and my free time is limited, it’s unlikely that you’ll find me writing posts on the latest CSS feature, even if it is a subject that interests me greatly.

## Who are you writing for?

Shout out to my RSS fam\! I’m never really sure who my audience is, I think I just try to publish every once in a while to remind people that I still exist. The typical reader is:

- Interested in front-end web development or accessibility
- Cares about the web ecosystem
- Not very likely to hire me, despite the original intentions of this blog, lol

## What’s your favorite post on your blog?

This one, [What Tumblr taught me about accessibility](https://www.nicchan.me/blog/what-tumblr-taught-me-about-accessibility/) is probably my magnum opus. It feels like something that only I can write, which is the goal for this blog. It still pretty much sums up my approach to accessibility, which is more person-centered rather than compliance-centered.

## Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?

I often toy with the idea of webmentions. I really like them in theory, I just feel like there’s quite a bit of a hurdle to jump through. I had them on a previous iteration of the blog, but when I changed the casing of my Twitter handle at the time, all my mentions disappeared, so I never bothered to bring it back.

## Life updates

- I’ve been a part of the [Grid-aware Websites](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/tools/grid-aware-websites/) (aka GAW) advisory board over the past few months. I’ve been delighted to get to work with the Green Web Foundation folks (particularly [Fershad](https://fershad.com/), Hannah and [Chris](https://chrisadams.me.uk/)), and all the other members of the advisory board. When the world feels like it’s on fire, it’s encouraging to show up to a room of people who really care about making it a little better. I hope to publish something on Grid-aware websites in the coming months.

- Switched some of my browsing over to Zen Browser\! I still need to use Chrome for some tasks (I can’t seem to use Figma with my pointer device of choice, a drawing tablet), but overall I enjoy Zen, and I think it makes me a better developer to use non-Chromium browsers regularly. I did not like that I had to do some work/install extensions to get the scrollbar to show up in the UI though.

- Managed to get all my Kindle books files before Amazon decided to be an ass and remove that feature. I’m definitely not getting another Kindle once this one dies, but I’ve had it since 2017 and it’s still somehow going strong. It feels more wasteful to throw away a perfectly functioning device, even if I want to boycott the company that makes it.

- Been attending a lot of life drawing\! I really enjoy it. I missed the entirety of the good plein-air weather in Hong Kong in my work-induced fervor, but this is something I can keep doing in the summer too.

## Tag, you're it

I'm technically supposed to tag someone, but since I'm over a month late to the trend, I had difficulties finding anyone who is a regular blogger left untagged! If you've been in a rut and want to get back into blogging, take this as a gentle encouragement to use this post format. Let me know if it gets you back into blogging and I'll link you here.
